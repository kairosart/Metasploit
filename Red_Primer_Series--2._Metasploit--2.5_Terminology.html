    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>2.5 Terminology</h1><br/><br /><br />The following terminology  is not only used within the Metasploit Framework, but throughout the  professional hacking and penetration testing communities. As a result,  any professional in this field should be familiar with these terms and  be able to clearly distinguish them.<br /><br /><strong>• Exploit</strong><br /> Exploit  is the means by which an attacker takes advantage of a flaw or  vulnerability in a network, application, or service. The hacker uses  this flaw or vulnerability in a way that the developer or engineer never  intended, to achieve a desired outcome (e.g. root access). Some more  common exploits that you&#39;ve probably already heard of are SQL  injections, buffer overflows, etc.<br /><br /><strong>• Payload</strong><br /> A  payload is the program or code that is delivered to the victim system.  Metasploit has pre-built payloads for this purpose included in the  highly useful Meterpreter, or you can develop your own. This payload is  designed to provide the attacker with some capability to manage or  manipulate the target system for their particular needs.<br /><br /><strong>• Shellcode</strong><br /> This  is a set of instructions used as a payload when the exploitation  occurs. Shellcode is typically written in assembly language, but not  necessarily always. It&#39;s called &quot;shellcode&quot; because a command shell or  other command console is provided to the attacker that can be used to  execute commands on the victim&#39;s machine.<br /><br /><strong>• Module</strong><br /> A  module is a piece of software that can be used by the Metasploit  Framework. These modules are interchangeable and give Metasploit its  unique power. These modules might be exploit modules or auxiliary  modules.<br /><br /><strong>• Listener</strong><br /> This  is that component that listens for the connection from the hacker&#39;s  system to the target system. The listener simply handles the connection  between these systems.<br /><br /><strong>• Show</strong><br /> Metasploit  Framework has hundreds of modules and other utilities. As a result, you  will not be able to remember them all. Fortunately, the show command  can grab a listing of all modules, options, targets, etc. in your  framework.<br /><p align="center"><img src="images/home.svg" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></div></body></html>
